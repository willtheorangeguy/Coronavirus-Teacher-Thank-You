      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Three Things I Enjoyed This Year:</h2>
      <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
        <li><span>The classroom atmosphere was always very chill, but that usually meant we didn't get a lot of work done :)</span></li>
        <li><span>Trigonometry was fun but also challenging.</span></li>
        <li><span>I always thought that the quote above and the sign in your room went very well with Bryan Abel.</span></li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Thank you for making this year a great success, looking forward to a more “normal” next year!<br>- William

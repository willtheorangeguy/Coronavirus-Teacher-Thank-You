      <h2>“Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the
      sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the
      pioneer and perfecter of faith.”</h2>
